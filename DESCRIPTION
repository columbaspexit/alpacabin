Description: alpacabin provides one solution to one specific version of the bin 
    packing problem: when you have a bunch of items, all with the same dimensions, 
    how many fit in a box/bin? The heuristic used by pack_bin is based on how 
    someone might pack a bin themselves, by way of a mess of matrix transformations.
